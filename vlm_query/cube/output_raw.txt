The task "put the red cube on the green cube" involves two stages:
1. Grasp the red cube.
2. Place the red cube on top of the green cube.

num_stages = 2

### stage 1 sub-goal constraints
def stage1_subgoal_constraint1(end_effector, keypoints):
    """Align the end-effector with the red cube (keypoint 0)."""
    red_cube_keypoint = keypoints[0]
    cost = np.linalg.norm(end_effector - red_cube_keypoint)
    return cost

### stage 1 path constraints
# No path constraints needed for grasping stage

### stage 2 sub-goal constraints
def stage2_subgoal_constraint1(end_effector, keypoints):
    """The red cube (keypoint 0) is 10cm above the green cube (keypoint 1)."""
    red_cube_keypoint = keypoints[0]
    green_cube_keypoint = keypoints[1]
    offsetted_point = green_cube_keypoint + np.array([0, 0, 0.1])  # 10cm above
    cost = np.linalg.norm(red_cube_keypoint - offsetted_point)
    return cost
